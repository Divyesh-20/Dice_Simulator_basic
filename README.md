# Dice Simulator Basic
This is a simple Python program that simulates rolling a dice. Each roll generates a random number between 1 and 6, and the corresponding face of the dice is displayed in the console.

How It Works
The program uses Python's random module to generate a random number between 1 and 6.
Based on the generated number, the program prints the corresponding dice face using ASCII art.
After each roll, the user is prompted to roll again or exit the program.
